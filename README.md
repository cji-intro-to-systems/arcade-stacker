Project 9: Stacker in Jack

The objective of Stacker is to create a stack of blocks.
The game is located in the `Stacker` directory.

### Rules:
- Press `[spacebar]` to position a block
- Stack blocks on top of each other
- If when dropped, the block does not contact the previous block, the game ends
- Stack 20 blocks to win
- (The easiest way to win is to hit `[spacebar]` rapidly, immediately after starting the game)

### Issues:
I sometimes have to load the game twice in the VM Emulator before it works...
